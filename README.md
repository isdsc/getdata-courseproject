### Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project

This materials in this repository will reproduce the tasks to collect, work with, and clean a data
set as defined in the course project for "Getting and Cleaning Data" which is the third course in
the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization series on Coursera.

The specific tasks for creating a tidy dataset are:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each
   variable for each activity and each subject.

The second part of the assignment states that the code should have a file named "run_analysis.R" in
the main directory of the repository that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in the "working
directory". The output should be the tidy data set submitted for part 1 (from step 5).

### Instructions to Run the R Code

To keep the project files organized, the data files are put in their own subdirectory called
"data". The script will start by setting the working directory
