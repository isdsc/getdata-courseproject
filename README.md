### Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This materials in this repository will reproduce the tasks to collect, work
with, and clean a data set as defined in the course project for "Getting and
Cleaning Data" which is the third course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science
Specialization series on Coursera.

The specific tasks are

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each
   measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set
   with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
