# This file contains R code to accomplish the tasks assigned in
#           Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
# 
# 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for
#    each measurement.
# 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
# 5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set
#    with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
#
# The required data files need to be stored in a subdirectory called "data".
